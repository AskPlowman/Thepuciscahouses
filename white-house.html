Tina was great, very responsive and helped us coordinate rides and was so helpful !  The town was within easy walking distance and we enjoyed the great restaurants.   Thank you Nicola and Tina!

                Nicola's home is not only the most amazing Airbnb I've ever stayed in, it was also in the most gorgeous town I've ever seen. The stay was 100% dreamy. Nicola helped us connect with a taxi driver, boat company, transport, massage therapist who came to the home and a chef. Even without all of those extras, this house was perfect in every way. We didn't even get to experience many beautiful parts because there was so much to do - the outdoor kitchen is amazing, the pool has a view to die for and the best memory will be watching the stars from the roof top. We had a very enjoyable time and Nicola and Tina are truly special hosts - thank you both for an incredible stay - we cannot wait to come back!

                Absolutely spectacular! Our stay at this huge villa in Pučišća was everything we dreamed of and more. The White House is stunning—perched above the town with extraordinary views that take your breath away. Each bedroom was incredibly spacious and perfectly comfortable, and the entire home was spotless and beautifully maintained.
                We spent our days lounging by the pool, soaking in the sun and the scenery, and wandering down to the local beach, where the crystal-clear water was perfect for swimming and frolicking.
                We were a large family group, and the villa suited us perfectly. From the moment we arrived, we felt right at home.  The fridge was stocked with everything we needed for a delicious breakfast. And thanks to Nicola’s recommendation, we hired a private chef who was so good, we brought him back for a second meal—absolutely outstanding!
                This villa was the perfect place to relax, reconnect, and enjoy the beauty of Croatia.  We loved our stay and can’t wait to come back!

                We had a wonderful stay at the White House! It's even more beautiful then the pictures show with amazing views from each room. It was spotlessly clean and all the bedrooms are the perfect size. We loved hanging out at the pool and hot tub enjoying the amazing views. We loved our entire stay and would definitely return.
